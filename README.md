# GraphQL Prayer Times API
There exists numerous REST API's for Islamic prayer times, however, there are not many (or any to my knowledge) in GraphQL. For this reason, I've created a GraphQL prayer times API for the type security and data efficiency GraphQL provides.
All calculations are done by the server and there are no external API dependencies except for geocoding latitude and longitude positions when getting times by city/country or address.
